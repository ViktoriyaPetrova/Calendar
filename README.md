A calendar that keeps track of to-do lists, video conference information, and
reminders. It uses inheritance, RTTI, DLL, and LLL to get the job done. 

It contains a main menu with 8 choices that helps test the different aspects of the 
program (inserting, removing, retrieving, displaying). Options 5 and 6 use RTTI as 
per program requirements. Options 1 - 3 use upcasting and dynamic binding.
